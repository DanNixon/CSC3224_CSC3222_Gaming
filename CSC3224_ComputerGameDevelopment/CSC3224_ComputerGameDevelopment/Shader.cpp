It's nice to have a robust program, that can handle things going wrong in them!
To enhance the robustness of your coursework, I've added some functionality not
really discussed in the tutorial notes. If one of your shader programs fails to
compile for some reason, it will revert to using a default vertex and fragment
program, that transforms the cube correctly, but makes it bright pink, to make
it obvious that something's gone wrong! You can test in your code whether a
shader has failed in such a way using the UsingDefaultShader function.

If you really want, you can disable this by commenting out the define below.

OpenGL shader programs can have many different combinations of
vertex/fragment/geometry/tcs/tes, so I've made a combined constructor that can
handle this. Just use "" as the parameter for any shader stage you aren't using,
as the code checks for non-empty strings. As you must always have a vertex and
fragment shader stage, these come first, while the others are defaulted to "".

Unlike most other OpenGL objects, you can't create multiple programs at once,
you just receive a program name from the glCreateProgram function - I'm not
sure why they did this!

I've done a trick both in here and in the Mesh class involving how enums are
created - by default a new enum will be 1 larger than the previous entry. This
means that if you start your first enum entry with a value of 0, the last entry
will be a value suitable for using as an array size to keep all of the previous
entries. I use this to create a compile-time array large enough to store all of
the possible shader objects we might need, using an easy-to-read variable name.

The shader files you create are just text - they must be compiled into
machine code compatible with your graphics card, just as with your C++ code.

All shader objects are of a specific 'type' (vertex/fragment/geometry etc),
so when you create a shader object using glCreateShader, you must set this.

One you have loaded a shader file, you can tell OpenGL about it using the
glShaderSource function - you can send multiple text files at once using this
function, so you could create your own #include system by parsing your text
files. Once you've sent the text to OpenGL, you can tell it to turn it into
a shader object using glCompileShader. If your driver fails to compile the
code, you can query information on why its failed using the 'info log', which
will return a string telling you about what warnings and errors it found.

When a vertex buffer is bound to the pipeline, it is attached to a
specific generic 'attribute', numbered between 0 and whatever the max
your driver implementation can do (generally this is at least 15).

Your shader needs to know how to interpret these generic attributes, and it
can do this in one of two ways - either 'layout qualifiers' in the vertex
shader itself, or by using the glBindAttribLocation function. For basic vertex
data that is used across lots of shaders, I prefer the latter method, as it acts
as a generic interface that any shader will work with as long as it uses the same
variable names, without having to really care about how the data is sent to it.

The glBindAttribLocation takes 3 parameters, a shader program, a generic attribute
index, and a string variable name, which will be an 'in' value in the vertex shader.

As you can see, I've matched up these generic attribute indices to the mesh class vertex
buffers, so the connecting of vertex buffers to any shader loaded via my class happens
'automagically'. It's perfectly safe to attempt to bind a non-existant input variable,
so it's generally a good idea to just attempt to bind all of your commonly used vertex
attributes
